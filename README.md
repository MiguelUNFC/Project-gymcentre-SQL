# Project GymCentre SQL

This project aims to design and implement a complete database system for a fitness centre.  
The process includes creating tables, editing structures, importing data, and running queries to explore and analyze the dataset.  
Data was sourced from public web resources and supplemented with AI-generated samples to simulate realistic scenarios.

## Repository Contents
- **Registration data (CSV):** Used to populate the `registration` table.
- **Class registration data (CSV):** Used to populate the `class_registration` table.
- **DDL scripts:** SQL code for table creation.
- **DML scripts:** SQL code for data insertion and updates.
- **DQL scripts:** SQL queries for data exploration and mining.
- **ER diagram (FitnessCentre.png):** Visual representation of the database schema.
- **Draw.io file (FitnessCentre.drawio):** Editable version of the ER diagram.


## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the full lifecycle of database creation and management, from schema design to data analysis.
